&lt;p&gt;Building a strong and cohesive team is not easy, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in software engineering or e-sports! Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://hr.mit.edu/learning-topics/teams/articles/stages-development&#34;&gt;Tuckman‚Äôs Stages of Team Development&lt;/a&gt;, using the famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t1.gg/teams/leagueoflegends&#34;&gt;T1 League of Legends team&lt;/a&gt; as an example. This e-sports team has gone through all the ups and downs of team development, and their journey is a great lesson for us in the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs break it down and see how T1 went from the Forming stage to the Performing stage‚Äîand why keeping your team together, upskilling, and believing in internal promotion is key to success! üöÄ&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-team-topologies-relates-to-the-different-positions-played-in-league-of-legends&#34;&gt;How Team Topologies Relates to the Different Positions Played in League of Legends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both software development and competitive gaming, effective team structure and collaboration are critical to achieving success. Whether you are managing a sofware engineering team or playing a game of League of Legends (LoL), how you organise your team and define roles impacts the overall performance and outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;m going to draw an interesting comparison between &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtopologies.com/&#34;&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/a&gt;: a framework used to define and optimise team structures in modern software engineering, and the positions in League of Legends. While one is about creating scalable and efficient software, and the other is about winning a fast-paced game, the principles of collaboration, specialised roles, and strategic alignment remain the same. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the book: Team Topologies yet, please checkout my previous blog post on book recommendations where it has more information about this blog and why you should read it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
