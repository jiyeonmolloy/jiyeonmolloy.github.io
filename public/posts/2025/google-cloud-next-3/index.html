With Google SecOps, detection becomes modular, testable, and highly effective.\n🧩 Composite Rules 🐐 Rather than putting every condition into a giant, brittle detection rule, Google SecOps encourages the use of composite rules. Think of them like reusable LEGO bricks 🧱: create small, atomic rules for specific behaviours, then chain them together to form higher-order detections. This lets you mix curated rules with your own custom logic to handle complex attack patterns or environment-specific edge cases.\n💡 Detection Engineering Building detections is no longer a siloed task. It now follows an engineering mindset:\nUse a rules editor to create and manage logic 📐 Integrate with entity graphs to link events, users, and resources 📈 Leverage CI/CD pipelines and Git-based version control to test, approve, and safely deploy new rules — just like software 🚀 🤖 Built-In Intelligence Google SecOps comes packed with visualisation tools, threat analytics, and even AI-assisted capabilities to help you prioritise and refine detections. There are also pre-built cloud threat packages for quick wins — and you can go deep with custom detections tailored to identity platforms like OKTA.\n🏰 Securing Cloud Infrastructure with Google Policy Management When it comes to cloud security, having strong guardrails in place is important. Google Cloud’s built-in policy management tools help you bake security, reliability, and cost efficiency right into your infrastructure.\n🛡️ Define and Enforce Org-Wide Policies With custom organisation policies, you can control exactly what’s allowed across your GCP projects:\nBlock risky configurations Enforce multi-region deployment Prevent unsafe services from being enabled These constraints act like guardrails — making sure no one accidentally configures something that could hurt security or cost 💸.\n🧪 Test Before You Enforce Rolling out policies shouldn’t be a huge risk. Google Cloud supports dry-run modes, policy simulations, and impact analysis — letting you test what a policy would do before enforcing it. This helps teams roll out security at scale without breaking critical services.\n🔐 Security Best Practices Baked In Need a starting point? Check out Google’s Security Baseline — a collection of best practices like:\nAvoiding long-lived credentials like service account keys Restricting external sharing and domain access Setting secure defaults across the board Combined with policy intelligence tools, you can even get smart recommendations to improve posture based on real usage 🔐 Securing Default Google Cloud Service Accounts Default service accounts are convenient — but they can also be a hidden risk 😬. Left unmanaged, they may have far more permissions than they should.\n👀 Know What You’ve Got Start by auditing what’s out there. You can use the following gcloud commands to uncover default service accounts attached to Compute Engine instances:\n📌 List all default service accounts attached to Compute instances: gcloud compute instances list --filter=\"serviceAccounts.email:~'compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com'\" 📌 Find default service accounts with full Cloud API access: gcloud compute instances list --filter=\"serviceAccounts.email:~'compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com' AND serviceAccounts.scopes:(https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform)\" These accounts often exist quietly, but can become high-value targets for attackers if they have excessive permissions.\n🚫 Lock It Down To tighten security:\nDisable automatic role grants for default accounts. Use Workload Identity Federation in GKE instead of service account keys. Replace broad-purpose service accounts with single-purpose accounts that follow the principle of least privilege It’s not just about defence — it’s about control, auditability, and predictability 🔐.\n📡 Building a Cloud Detection Strategy for Incident Response Detection strategies shouldn’t be based on feelings — they should be grounded in threat modelling and built around what actually matters to your organisation.\n🔍 Let Threats Drive Your Detections Instead of starting with logs and trying to make sense of them, start with the threats. What’s most likely to target your cloud environment? What attack paths are realistic?\nFrom there, engineer your detections around real attacker behaviours — not just compliance requirements.\n📚 Logging is Your Foundation Make sure you’re collecting:\nControl plane audit logs (API calls, IAM changes). Data plane logs (read/write activity on storage and databases). Application logs for custom insights. Not all logs are enabled by default, so double-check what’s flowing through your Security Infromation and Event Management (SIEM) or analytics stack 📊.\n🧭 Security Maturity Milestones As your detection capabilities grow, so does your maturity:\nCompliance-focused (basic log collection, static rules). Use-case driven (contextual rules, incident correlation). Threat intelligence driven (adaptive detections, real-time response). Knowing where you stand helps you plan the next step on your journey 🛤️.\n💖 Wrapping Up: Building Smarter, Safer Cloud Systems Together From detection logic to policy enforcement and service account hardening, it’s clear that modern cloud operations are as much about engineering as they are about security. By combining tools like Google SecOps, organisation policies, and strong IAM practices, teams can move fast and stay secure 🏎️🛡️.\n","wordCount":"818","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/assets/images/eevee-on-computer-circle.png","datePublished":"2025-04-30T20:17:49+12:00","dateModified":"2025-04-30T20:17:49+12:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/google-cloud-next-3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ji Molloy","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/assets/favicon/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/ title=home><span>home</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/portfolio/ title=portfolio><span>portfolio</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">☁ Google Cloud Next Series ☁️🔐 Building Smarter, Safer Cloud Systems Together 🛡️💻✨</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-04-30 20:17:49 +1200 NZST'>April 30, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;818 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=post-content><p><img alt="alt text" loading=lazy src=/assets/images/eeevee-and-charizard-security-experts.png></p><p>Helloo! 👋 How are you?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s learn more about cloud security, detection engineering, and scalable policies 🐱🚀</p><h2 id=-detection-engineering-with-google-secops>🔍 Detection Engineering with Google SecOps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-detection-engineering-with-google-secops>#</a></h2><p>Detection engineering isn’t just about catching threats — it’s about building a smart, scalable detection machine 🛠️.
