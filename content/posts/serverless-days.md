## Serverless Days!

Click [here](https://anz.serverlessdays.io/auckland/) to see the full agenda

I had the amazing opportunity to attend ServerLess Days. If you are working with serverless technology and would like to meet other active developers and technical leaders from across the Australia & New Zealand region, while hearing from some world-class speakers, I highly recommend attending this event!

Here is a quick recap of my learnings!!


### Think, Architect, and Build Serverless Applications as Set Pieces 
#### Speaker: [Sheen Brisals](https://anz.serverlessdays.io/speakers/sheen/)

- Accumulated architecture HIDES complexity
- Distributed architecture SHOWS the complexity
- Problem Decomposition 
    - Utilise serverless characteristics
        - Event-driven architecture
        - Using managed services
        - Infrastructure-as-code ‚ô•
    - Employ PROVEN patterns
        - [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html)
            - Domains and sub-domains
            - [Bounded context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)
        - [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)
            - Team ownership and custodians
        - Microservices
            - Independently releasable single-purpose services
    - SUSTAIN the architecture, application and processes üå≥
        - ‚¨á sustainability: Waterfall development
        - ‚¨Ü sustainability: 
            - Serverless ways of thinking
            - Evolving architecture
            - Minimum Viable Product (MVP üåü)
            - Modular, extendable and observable product
        - Follow lean principles
        - Improve Value Stream
        - Agile & Pragmatic
        - Start SMALL and scale!
        - Evolve in ITERATIONS
        - Automate EVERYTHING üòé
        - DevOps Mindset
        - Refactor Continuously üíñ
- Growing talent in the team üåª
    - Enablement within the team üåº
    - Celebrating wins
    - Instill ownership

###  Whether Serverless or Not, It's all about how you drive your project! 
#### Speaker: [Nelly Sattari](https://anz.serverlessdays.io/speakers/nelly/)
- Keywords: Accountable, Agile, Healthy and Focused
- The art of impossible
    - Coach - Helping individuals
    - Connector - Building a healthy team
    - Conductor - Driving projects
    - Compass - Setting the direction
- Don't forget to connect with stakeholders
- [Atlas](https://www.atlassian.com/software/atlas) Atlassian product that is a teamwork directory. For example, every Monday we can review how the team is doing!
- Making it clear what everyone's roles and responsibilities are
- Building an Agile Team
    - Fixed: People, Team and Scope
    - Epic ‚ñ∂ Milestone
        - Incremental delivery
        - Breakdown MVP
        - Carry out within 1 to 2 sprints
    - Importance of Sprint Goals ‚öΩ
        - Achieving Sprint Goals is MORE important than shipping all the tickets
        - Each milestone could be a goal?
        - Goal setting meeting to review if the team met their goals in the previous sprint
            - Teams can answer YES, PARTIALLY or NO
            - If the sprint goal hasn't been met, have a meeting to identify why the goals were not met
            - Other Agile Rituals include Sprint Checkpoint and Capacity Planning
- üíü DATA DRIVEN LEADERS üíü
    - Identifying work that is carried over multiple sprints, what are the dependencies? Why was this work not completed within the sprint?
    - Measuring velocity
    - Measure everything, no "gut feelings"
- Connection
    - Social events
    - Celebrating milestones
    - Recognition
    - Beware of burn-outs!
- Collaboration
    - Providing training
    - Mentoring and pairing
- Data-Driven Engineer who recognises importance of Agile rituals
- More team members can cause overhead
    - Adding more team members doesn't mean the team will have higher velocity
- Developing self-healing / stateless / idempotent systems
- Working on serverless and real time observability
- Summary
    - Do the simple thing first
    - Small team with fast feedback loop - showcase often
    - Identify risk early, shift-left and spike
    - Continuously measure performance and stress test
    - Isolate context boundaries (lambdas)
    - Solution must prove itself correct

###  Using serverless functions for real-time observability 
#### Speaker: [Liz Fong-Jones](https://anz.serverlessdays.io/speakers/liz/)
- Most realtime bulk workloads benefit
    - Move state from local machines onto object storage
    - Shard list of objects into work units
    - Parallelise object processing
    - Reduce results outside Lambda afterwards
- Beware the dragons! üêâ
    - Avoid latency-insensitive batch workloads (cost)
    - Avoid tiny workloads (set-up latency)
    - Check cloud provider limits, state your intentions (capacity planning)
    - Test cross-compilation including profiling to avoid performance issues with switchign architectures
