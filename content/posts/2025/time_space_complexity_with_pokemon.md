When writing code, we often want to know *how fast* it runs ⏩ and *how much memory* it uses 💾. This is where **time complexity** and **space complexity** comes in! Let's break these down using Pokémon themed examples! 🔥

## ⚡ Big O Notation - The Trainer’s Guide 📖

[Big O notation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/) helps us understand how an algorithm scales as the input size grows. Think of it as training a Pokémon: some level up quickly ⚡, while others take longer ⏳!

We’ll go through different complexities using **Pokémon-related Python code** and compare their speed and memory usage. Let’s gooo! 🎮🔥

---

## 🟢 O(1) - Constant Time 📏

### Example: Checking a Pokémon's Type 🛡️🔥

If an operation **always takes the same time**, no matter the input size, it’s **O(1)**.

```python
pokemon_types = {
    "Pikachu": "Electric",
    "Charmander": "Fire",
    "Squirtle": "Water"
}

def get_pokemon_type(name):
    return pokemon_types.get(name) 

print(get_pokemon_type("Pikachu"))  # ⚡ Electric
```

No matter how many Pokémon are in the dictionary, looking one up is instant ⚡! This is because Python dictionaries use hash tables, which allow for average-case O(1) lookups. Instead of searching through the entire list, the dictionary computes a unique hash for the key (Pokémon name), and directly accesses its corresponding value (type). This makes lookups extremely efficient compared to searching through a list, which would take O(N) time.


## 🔵 O(log N) - Logarithmic Time 📉

### Example: Searching for a Pokémon in a Sorted Pokedex 📜

If every step reduces the problem in half (like a binary search), it’s O(log N).

```python
def binary_search(pokedex, target):
    left, right = 0, len(pokedex) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if pokedex[mid] == target:
            return f"{target} found! 🎉 Yay!"
        elif pokedex[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return f"{target} not found 😢 oh noo!"

pokedex = ["Bulbasaur", "Charizard", "Eevee", "Pikachu", "Squirtle"]  # Sorted list 📜
print(binary_search(pokedex, "Pikachu"))  # Found in log(N) time!
```

Each step halves the search space — super efficient! 🔥

## 🟡 O(N) - Linear Time 🚶‍♂️

### Example: Finding a Pokémon in a Tall Grass Patch 🌿👀

If we need to go one by one through a list, it’s O(N).

```python
def find_pokemon(grass, target):
    for pokemon in grass:
        if pokemon == target:
            return f"{target} appeared! 🎉"
    return "No Pokémon found 😞"

grass = ["Pidgey", "Rattata", "Caterpie", "Pikachu"]
print(find_pokemon(grass, "Pikachu"))  # O(N) search
```

If the wild Pokémon is at the end, we have to check every single one 😰!

## 🟠 O(N²) - Quadratic Time 😵

### Example: Checking All Pokémon Battle Pairs ⚔️

If we compare every Pokémon with every other, it’s O(N²).

```python
team = ["Bulbasaur", "Charmander", "Squirtle", "Pikachu"]

def battle_pairs(team):
    for pokemon1 in team:
        for pokemon2 in team:
            if pokemon1 != pokemon2:
                print(f"{pokemon1} battles {pokemon2}! ⚔️")

battle_pairs(team)  # O(N²) - Too slow for large teams! 🐌
```

This gets really slow with big teams! 🚶‍♂️→🏃‍♂️→🐌

## 🔴 O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time 😱

### Example: Generating All Possible Pokémon Teams 🎲

If an algorithm doubles its work for every extra input, it’s O(2ⁿ) ... very bad!

```python
def generate_teams(team):
    if not team:
        return [[]]
    smaller_teams = generate_teams(team[:-1])
    return smaller_teams + [t + [team[-1]] for t in smaller_teams]

pokemon_team = ["Pikachu", "Charizard", "Blastoise"]
print(generate_teams(pokemon_team))  # Exponential growth! 🚀
```

This explodes FAST! 🚀 Not ideal for large inputs! 🔥

## 💾 Space Complexity - How Much Memory? 🧠

- O(1) Space: Uses constant memory (e.g. a few variables ✅)
- O(N) Space: Uses memory proportional to input size (e.g. storing all Pokémon in a list 📜)
- O(N²) Space: Stores all possible Pokémon matchups 😵
- O(2ⁿ) Space: Keeps ALL possible Pokémon teams in memory! 🔥

## Summary Table

| **Complexity** | **Time**         | **Example**                     |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| O(1)           | Fastest ⚡       | Dictionary lookup 🔎           |
| O(log N)       | Fast 📈         | Binary search in Pokédex 📜     |
| O(N)           | Medium 🚶‍♂️    | Searching through grass (linear) 🌿          |
| O(N²)          | Slow 🐌         | All battle pairs ⚔️             |
| O(2ⁿ)          | Super Slow 🔥   | Generating all possible teams (exponential) 🎲 |

## 🎉 Conclusion

Understanding time and space complexity helps you write better and faster code! 🏆 Next time you code, think: is this the most efficient way? ⚡ Or will it take forever like Magikarp using Splash? 🐟😂
