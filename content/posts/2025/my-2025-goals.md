Helloo 2025! 🎉 This year, I’m taking a declarative approach to my career, because why not manage your goals like you manage your infrastructure? 😄

I like to visit my goals half way through the year 😉!

Here’s what my intentions for the year looks like:

```yaml
goals:
  - certification: "One per year"
  - conferences:
      - in_person: 1
      - meetups: "a few"
  - speaking:
      - internal: true
      - external: true
team: "Kubernetes Platform"
joined: "6 weeks ago"
learning_style: ["KodeKloud", "books", "breaking things", "blogs"]
```

Let’s break it down together 😎

## 🎯 My 2025 Goals as a Software Engineer
This year, I want to push myself in three key areas:

- ✅ One certification per year: I find certs help me stay focused and dive deeper. This year, I'm interested in [CKA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/) and [AWS AI Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/) 🔐
- 🎟️ Attend at least one conference in-person, and a few meetups throughout the year. It’s a really good way to stay connected and inspired.
- 🎤 Speak up! At my company internally and at a meetup or conference (in-person!). I would also love to share my knowledge and experiences so far 🥰

## 🧪 6 Weeks in the Kubernetes Platform Team
It’s already been about 6 weeks since I joined the Kubernetes Platform team, and it’s already stretched my thinking in new ways.

I have been diving into:

- 🌐 Cluster management
- 💸 FinOps considerations
- 🤖 Autoscaling mysteries
- 🧩 Designing for engineering experience

The shift has been exciting, and I'm learning heaps with awesome team members. I will be writing future blog posts on some of these topics 😁

## 🛠️ What Helped Me Learn Faster
### 📚 Learning Resources I Loved
- 🎥 [CKA Course on KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/courses/cka-certification-course-certified-kubernetes-administrator?refererPath=%2Fuser%2Flearning-paths%2Fcka&refererTitle=CKA): hands-on labs, bite-sized lessons, and straight to the point.
- 📘 [The Kubernetes Book by Nigel Poulton](https://goodreads.com/book/show/35494978-the-kubernetes-book): clear, well-structured, and really easy to understand the different concepts. 
    - I have already mentioned this book in a previous blog post 😄
- 🧪 Just trying things out and breaking stuff: spinning up test clusters, updating manifests, and debugging real errors.
- ✍️ Blogs by other awesome engineers: reading about how others approached various problems was super helpful. 💖 If you haven't seen these blogs already, please see:
    - [Carlo's Blogs on Medium](https://medium.com/@carlocolumna) 😸
    - [DevOps with Zack](https://blog.awsfanboy.com/) A.K.A. AWS Fan Boy 🤗
    - [One Concept Today](https://oneconcepttoday.online/) please try it out 🦄


## 🌻 Still Scaling (Myself)
Working in platform engineering has reminded me how much there is to learn, and how valuable it is to build empathy for our engineers 💡 Whether it's dealing with fun errors or helping teams ship faster, it’s all about solving interesting problems for our engineers.

Let’s keep learning (and scaling) together 🚀 `kubectl apply -f 2025.yaml`
