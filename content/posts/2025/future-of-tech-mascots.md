Over the past few years, I have been thinking about how `character culture` shapes industries: from idol groups to stationery aisles, from gacha machines to cafés. And recently, I was thinking of: **why aren’t tech mascots treated like real character IP?** 😆💭

We already know that characters with strong story, cute design, and a sense of collectability become global icons. For example:

- 🐼 [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us) where each Pokémon has a unique name, powers and personalities
- 🎀 [Sanrio](https://www.sanrio.com/) and its family of characters  
- 🎶 [BT21](https://www.bt21.com/character) and how each character represents a [BTS](https://ibighit.com/bts/eng/profile/) member
- ✨ [Chiikawa](https://www.chiikawaofficial.com/home/#characters), with every character having a backstory
- 🌐 [aespa](https://aespa.com/), whose AI universe concept ties all their songs and avaters together  


So… what about tech?

## 🐱‍💻 Tech mascots are already popular 😍

Some of the most recognisable icons come from the tech world:

- 🐙 [Octocat](https://myoctocat.com/) from GitHub  
- 🐳 The Docker whale [Moby Dock](https://www.docker.com/blog/call-me-moby-dock/)
- 🐧 [Tux the penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)) character for Linux

Engineers really like these techie characters. Stickers are very popular at conferences, and laptop lids become filled with techie stickers 💻💟

However, none of these characters have a background story or personalities. Each unique Octocat also has no unique name.
They are currently just logos, but I wonder if they could become *full character IP*, just like Chiikawa or BT21 ✨

## 🌈 Why characters become memorable

Characters become powerful when they have a personality and background story, as explained in [andacademy](https://www.andacademy.com/resources/blog/graphic-design/what-is-character-design/).

Imagine if Octocat variants like astronaut Octocat 🐱‍🚀, samurai Octocat 🐱‍👤, musician Octocat 🎻 each had names, mini bios, and a coherent universe. People could collect them like trading cards, aiming to complete the whole set. I think they would also become popular with everyone, not just software engineers.

## 🛍️ What if.. scenario! 😊😎

It would be really cool if:

### 🏬 At big shopping centers like Parco or Westfield there is:
- Octocat × Sanrio plushies and stickers 🐼
- Docker Whale keychains 🐳  
- Kubernetes mascot blind boxes 🎁
- Tux the penguin random figures [Gachapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon) 🎈
- Character cafés with themed pancakes 🥞

I think it would be popular with everyone, not just software engineers.

## 💖 Making engineering feel more friendly

Tech often can look complicated from the outside: complex, serious and full of abstract concepts. But character culture has the potential to make something technical feel more friendly and welcoming.

If techie mascots got more popular, it could potentially:

- attract more people into engineering
- make tech feel less cold and more approachable  
- encourage more underrepresented groups to join  
- create a positive cultural impression of software engineering  
- bring tech mascots into our everyday lifestyle

## 🌟 The future of tech mascots

I look forward to tech mascots becoming more popular and helping more people get interested in software engineering! ♥💕😍
