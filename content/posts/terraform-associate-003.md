## Benefits 🦘

[`Infrastructure Automation | HashiCorp Developer`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/certifications/infrastructure-automation)

I prepared for the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate certification, which is about:

- Fundamentals of Terraform: The certification covers core concepts and skills related to Terraform, including infrastructure as code (IaC), basic Terraform commands, and the ability to manage and deploy infrastructure using Terraform 📝 
- Practical Application: It focuses on practical knowledge, such as creating and managing Terraform configurations, understanding the Terraform workflow, and applying best practices for writing and organising Terraform code ⭐

## How I prepared books  (~ 6 weeks)

- [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Practice Exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/?couponCode=ST17MT91224A)
- [What is HCP Terraform? | Terraform | HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs)

I created a weekly schedule to study one practice exam per week. There are 5 practice exams and one final exam available which is slightly different: Terraform Fill-In-The-Blank Questions. 

| Day            | Activity                                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Monday**     | Practice Exam 1 ⏰                                                                               |
| **Tuesday ~ Wednesday** | Review correct and incorrect answers from Practice Exam 1 and read up Terraform docs!! 📺 |
| **Thursday**   | Practice Exam 1 (repeat) 📝 |
| **Friday**     | Review correct and incorrect answers from Practice Exam 1 - Review mode (Should be a lot less incorrect answers 😊) |

In areas that I wanted to know more about, I read the official Terraform docs. The Terraform experience I got from hands on work a helped a lot 😎. However, the confusing part was Terraform Cloud ☁ which I haven’t had hands on experience before, so I had to do a lot of reading and research. It had unique differences to Terraform Enterprise e.g. Terraform Workspaces can be managed through the Terraform Cloud web interface etc.

Once I passed all the practice exams, I scheduled the terraform certification! 

## Exam experience! 🦄

The only option was to do the exam online. Unfortunately, my first attempt was at the same time when Azure went down which crashed my exam just before I started Azure . Seems like the terraform exam portal is all hosted on Azure.

After one week, I was able to re-schedule using a voucher from Terraform Terraform 

It took about 20 minutes to check the surroundings of my computer where I was sitting the exam. I was asked to plug out various devices from the computer e.g. microphone . Also make sure your webcam cable is long enough to show under your desk. My cable was quite short, so I had to show the upside down version when showing under my desk.

Also, remember you will need one source of identification with you. I used my passport! You can have a cup of water in a transparent cup with you, but nothing else on the desk. Please remember to leverage the mark for review feature (for questions you are not 100% sure about). I found the questions quite similar to the practice exams.
